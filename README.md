# leaftlet-challenge

In this project we will be mapping earthquake data from around the world and displaying it in a meaningful way. By using leaflet we will be able to show a visualization of this data. 
We will choose and dataset and import the JSON file to give a map that will show the specific earthquake data chosen based on their latitude and longitude.

This will include:

Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

A legend that will provide context for your map data.

Your visualization should look something like the preceding map.
